            <p>Vettuvan Koil is an ancient and unfinished Shiva temple located in Kalugumalai, Tamil Nadu. The temple,
                which dates back to the 8th century, is a remarkable example of rock-cut architecture and is dedicated
                to the Hindu god Shiva. The temple complex, though incomplete, offers a glimpse into the grandeur of
                early Pandyan art.</p>
