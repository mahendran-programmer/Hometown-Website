            <p>Kalugasalamoorthy Temple (or Kalugumalai Murugan temple) in Kalugumalai, a panchayat town in Thoothukudi
                district in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu, is dedicated to the Hindu god Murugan. Constructed in
                the Dravidian style of architecture, the temple is believed to have been expanded during the 18th
                century
                with the images excavated from Kalugumalai. The core temple has a rock-cut architecture exemplary of
                early Pandyan Art. The other portions of Kalugumalai house the 8th century Kalugumalai Jain Beds and
                Vettuvan Koil, an unfinished Shiva temple.</p>

            <h2>Architecture</h2>
            <p>The temple is located in Kalugumalai, a rocky hill in Thoothukudi district in southern Tamil Nadu. The
                sanctum of the temple is approached through a pillared hall near the gateway. The temple tank is located
                outside the temple. The sanctum is built in a rock-cut cave, which houses the image of Murugan in the
                form of Kazhugachalamurthi in a seated posture. The sanctum faces West, and the image of the presiding
                deity is 4 ft (1.2 m) tall. The image is sported with six hands, one of them holding Vel (divine spear),
                his left leg over the shoulder of the peacock, and the right is left hanging.</p>
            <p>There are separate shrines for his consorts Valli facing South and Deivanai facing North. There is a
                separate shrine for Shiva and Parvathi and all the Parsvatah Devatas (attendant deities) associated with
                Shiva temples. Usually, in Murugan temples, his vehicle peacock would be heading towards his right, but
                it is sported on the left of Murugan in this temple. It is believed that Indra, the king of celestial
                deities, appeared as a peacock to worship Murugan. The image of the peacock is hence covered during the
                festivals.</p>

        <!-- History and Significance Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>History and Religious Significance</h2>
            <p>The images of the presiding deity were excavated from the Southwestern corner of Kalugumalai. The images
                were installed, and the leading pillared halls were constructed during the 18th century. The temple
                finds
                mention in Kanthapuranam, a work by Kachiappar. Kachiappar mentions that there are only three sacred
                temples of Murugan where he faces the South, and this is the only temple where he faces south and also
                in
                a seated posture.</p>
            <p>The temple was under the control of Ettaiyapuram Zamindar until 1954. The Raja gifted the village to the
                temple and formed five streets around the temple to enable the temple car to pass easily. He also
                allocated a middle street for the temple priests. During the Panguni Uthiram festival procession, the
                elongated conflict between two castes in the region, namely, Nadars and Maravars, resulted in a riot,
                popularly called Kalugumalai riots of 1895. A total of ten people were killed, many injured, and the
                temple car and other property in the region were destroyed.</p>

        <!-- Festivals Section -->
        <section class="section">
            <h2>Festivals</h2>
            <p>The temple priests perform the pooja (rituals) during festivals and on a daily basis. There are weekly,
                monthly, and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple. The temple is open from 5:30 am – 12:30 pm and
                6 - 9 pm on all days except during festive occasions when it has extended timings.</p>
            <p>The major festivals of the temple include the ten-day Vaikasi Visagam celebrated during the Tamil month
                of
                Vaikasi (May - June), the 13-day Kanthasasti festival, the ten-day Thaipoosam festival celebrated during
                the Tamil month of Thai (January - February), and the 13-day Panguni Uthiram festival during Panguni
                (March - April).</p>
            <p>Kalugumalai was chosen in the plan to be included as a rural tourism site in the Incredible India
                campaign
                by the Tourism Ministry of the Government of India. As a part of the campaign, the ministry allocated
                ₹10
                million to develop the infrastructure around the region in 2008. The tourist inflow to the town
                increased
                to 3,000 persons per month during 2009 from 400 per month during the previous years.</p>
